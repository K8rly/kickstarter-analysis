# kickstarter-analysis
Kickstarting with Excel

Overview of Project
	
	The purpose of this analysis was to assist Louise in determining whether her play will be successful, utilizing previous kickstarter trends. We examined how different kickstarter campaigns performed in relation to their funding goals and launch dates, based on the given dataset.

Analysis and Challenges
	
	Both sets of outcomes for this analysis utilized pivot charts to summarize categories most relevant to Louise’s purpose.

Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
	
	This analysis was performed by reviewing outcomes based on Launch Date according to month in order to show Louise when her play would be most likely to succeed. A line chart clearly shows a peak in success rate in the summer and a dip in success rate in December, providing a clear visual for Louise.

Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
	
	This analysis was performed by reviewing outcomes based on funding Goals in order to show Louise how much funding she would need for her play to be successful. With a line graph showing funding goal on the x axis, it’s clear that the lowest goal range yielded the most successful plays while the highest goal rate yielded the least successful plays.

Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
	
	The challenges encountered in this analysis were insignificant, but it’s possible that future analysis could face issues with debugging such a large dataset. Another challenge of a large dataset would be finding clean data to analyze in the first place. Finally, another challenge would be the detail of the data being analyzed. For instance, it is unclear what constitutes a successful outcome vs failed outcome. More detail would yield a more accurate analysis, which could be achieved by asking louise for additional information.

Results

Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
	
	Plays launched in May and June yielded the highest rate of successful outcomes with 111 and 100 plays, respectively; July and August were next producing 87 and 72 successful plays, respectively. With a sharp decline in successful outcomes December proved to be the lowest month with only 37 successful plays launched. The most obvious conclusions regarding Theater Outcomes by Launch Date were that plays launched in the summer months were more likely to succeed while plays launched in December were more likely to fail. This could be related to a lesser likelihood that people go to plays during a winter holiday month, and instead are visiting family or traveling. Weather could also be a possible deterrent to attending plays in the winter months.
	
Outcomes Based on Goals
	
	Plays with Goals less than $5000 had the highest success rate, while plays with a goal of $45,000 or more were more likely to fail. We can conclude that higher goal amounts are not correlated with higher success rates, while plays with lower goals actually seem to have a higher success rate. This analysis showed that no plays were canceled in the group; plays were only successful or failed. This analysis shows Louise that she does not need to set a high goal in order for her play to be successful, but would likely fare well if her play was launched during a summer month as opposed to a winter month.
	
Limitations
	
	One limitation would be that the results by launch date did not include percentages, only sums of outcomes. Future analysis may want to include percentages of successful versus failed plays in order to show a more accurate picture of the data. Another limitation is that theater outcomes based on goals summarize all theater programs - since there are several other categories of theater programs, this data is not specific to only plays.
	
Additional Charts
	
	While a line chart was created for the data being reviewed, a bar chart would also showcase a similar view of trends, depending on Louise’s preference. A custom combo chart may be useful in showing data points as well as trends within the same picture. Specifically a clustered column chart paints a nice picture of relational data for this analysis.
